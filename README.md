# Trash Bin Scavenger - Advanced Loot System for QBCore

Trash Bin Scavenger is a comprehensive FiveM script that transforms ordinary trash bins and dumpsters into interactive loot sources. This feature-rich system adds depth to your roleplay server by allowing players to search for useful items while building a unique scavenging progression system.

## üåü Key Features

### Core Systems
- **Interactive Trash Searching**: Search through various trash bins and dumpsters across the city
- **Progression System**: Gain reputation as you find more items, level up your scavenging skills
- **Persistent Player Data**: Player reputation and collectibles save to database between server restarts

### Advanced Gameplay Features
- **Lockpick System**: Large dumpsters require lockpicks with configurable difficulty tiers
